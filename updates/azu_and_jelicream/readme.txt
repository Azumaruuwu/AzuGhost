Hey there! This ghost is a work in progress, so there isn't much dialogue yet. Azumaru and Jelicream will sit on your computer and will talk to each other, you can pet them on their head or hit them if you wanna, but there isn't much dialogue planned to be directed at you specifically. 

To access their personal menus, make sure to double tap their head accessories and not their heads, or you'll hit them instead. Jelicream's menu can't do much, but inside Azumaru's menu you can change their speech rate and your name, pronouns, and birthday. Have fun!
